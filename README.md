Project Overview 
This project is a software application developed in Python, featuring a graphical user interface built with Tkinter 
and a relational database managed using SQLite. It is designed to simulate a university management system, 
allowing users to handle information about students, courses, professors, and exams. 
The application stands out for its ease of use and the integration of a machine learning model (linear regression)
to predict students' grade averages based on their age.
