Project Overview:

This project is a software application developed in Python, featuring a graphical user interface built with Tkinter 
and a relational database managed using SQLite. It is designed to simulate a university management system, 
allowing users to handle information about students, courses, professors, and exams. 
The application stands out for its ease of use and the integration of a machine learning model (linear regression)
to predict students' grade averages based on their age. 


In this PDF, we provide an overview of the tools used to create this management system, incorporating data visualization techniques and machine learning to perform predictive analyses.
